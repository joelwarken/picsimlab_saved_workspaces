A collection of saved workspace files, board configurations, and firmware examples created with **[PICSimLab](https://github.com/lcgamboa/picsimlab)** – an open-source simulation and development environment for microcontrollers.

This repository serves as both a personal backup and a resource for the community, whether you're learning embedded systems, testing new ideas, or reusing existing setups.

## 📁 Structure

Workspaces are organized by board, microcontroller, or project type:


Each folder typically includes:

- `.pzw` – PICSimLab workspace file
- `.hex` or `.elf` – Compiled firmware
- `README.md` – Project description and pin mapping (if applicable)
- Additional source code (`.c`, `.ino`, etc.)

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- [PICSimLab](https://github.com/lcgamboa/picsimlab) (version 0.8.0 or newer recommended)
- Optional: MPLAB X, Arduino IDE, or any compiler for the target microcontroller
